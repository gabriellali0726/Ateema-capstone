For those who attend the events: we build the right relationships and database, create invitations, get the right audience in the room, do check-in, manage the event, provide food and drinks, etc. A client can meet just 1 concierge, or planner and make more then the cost of the clients overall investment with us in just one year. Where else can the client get this access?",
